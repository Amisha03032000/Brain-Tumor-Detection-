# [Brain Tumor Detection]

Brain Tumor Test is a **Deep Learning Web Application** based on a **CNN Architecture** which uses MRI Scanned *clear* images to find out whether a patient is suffering from a brain tumor or not.

It also helps us to distinguish between the *types* of Brain Tumors which could be present. 


# What it is ?

Brain Tumor Test uses the concept of **Transfer Learning** which enables us to use the *weights and biases* of some of the famous CNN architectures which ***decreases the amount of computational time significantly.***

I've used the **EfficientNetB0** architecture for this task.


# Dataset

The dataset contains a total of **10000** images of MRI Scanned clear images of patients with and without brain tumors.
There are 3 major types of tumors which we're dealing with in this dataset:
- Meningioma Tumor
- Glioma Tumor
- Pituitary Tumor
Along with this, we also train the model on MRI Scanned images of patients who do ***not*** have a brain tumor.

The dataset is present on **Kaggle** and you can check it out by clicking on this link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)
